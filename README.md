# Loan-Predition Project Overview


- **Loan Prediction Project**: This web page is a Jupyter notebook that shows a data analysis and machine learning project on loan prediction. The goal is to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various features such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: The notebook performs some exploratory data analysis and visualization on the train and test datasets. It shows the distribution and frequency of different categorical and numerical variables, such as gender, education, property area, loan amount, etc. It also plots some bar charts and histograms to show the relationship between the variables and the loan status.
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: The notebook handles missing values and outliers in the data by using different imputation methods, such as mode, median, and log transformation. It also creates some new features, such as total income, EMI, and balance income, to capture the effect of income and loan amount on the loan status.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: The notebook uses logistic regression as the machine learning model to predict the loan status. It uses stratified k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model performance and accuracy score as the metric. It also plots the ROC curve and calculates the AUC score to measure the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. It then makes predictions on the test data and saves the results in a CSV file.
- In addition to logistic regression, the project also employed decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost models for the loan prediction task. A grid search was performed to optimize the parameters of these models. The performance of all these models was compared to identify the best model for predicting loan approval. This comprehensive approach ensures the robustness and accuracy of the predictions.
